## Introduction

MovieD is a beautiful looking Movie list based project to showcase the [Android Architecture components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture).
It implements:-
- the [MVVM](https://medium.com/upday-devs/android-architecture-patterns-part-3-model-view-viewmodel-e7eeee76b73b) pattern
- DI using [Koin](https://github.com/InsertKoinIO/koin)
- using [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) to make network calls with the help of [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/)
- serves and maintains the data using [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/arch/lifecycle/LiveData)
- navigation across the app happens after harnessing the power of the [Navigation component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation), also showcasing how to achieve shared element transition using Navigation component

Most other examples of the Architecture components that I could find on GitHub were mostly a little too easy or a little too complex, here comes MovieD which maintains a fine balance of both. I have tried to keep it simple yet not too simple. I will be glad if even one persons gains something out of this! If you like it, please leave a ‚≠ê üòÅ

## Things to Look Out For

The main features illustrated in this project are :-

- MVVM Architecture
- How a ViewModel can survive configuration changes
- Dependency Injection using KOIN
- How LiveData works
- Simple Navigation component
- Advanced Navigation component (Shared element transition)
- Coroutines basic

## Installation
To successfully run this project, you would need an `API key` which you can easily get from [here](https://www.themoviedb.org/login). Once you have obtained the `API key` please create a file named `ApiKey.kt` at the path :-
     <br> <br> `/app/src/main/java/com/zebrostudio/movied/utils/ApiKey.kt`<br><br>
and declare a field `const val API_KEY = <Your API key here>`

And you should be good to go!

A big thanks to [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-US) for providing the amazing API from where the movies are sourced.<br>
The UI was inspired from this awesome [design](https://dribbble.com/shots/8257559-Movie-2-0) on Dribble
